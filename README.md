Unity Version: 6.1.4f1
This is a test assigment done for PlayStudios.
All of the core functionalities are done and I tried my best to use S.O.L.I.D and D.R.Y and other design patterns in it.
The project doesnt have any SFX and VFX BUT due to clean archtitecture its really easy to add but I didn't because of time restrictions.

I have also developed some small tooling to be able to define new Tetrominos and Blocks really easily.
Also all of the score settings are accessible via TetrisBlock > Settings menu:

There is still a lot of things to add and to work on but I think for now its enough to showcase my coding style and skills and there is no need to spend more time on it.
