Unity Version: 6.1.4f1 â€” APK file is located in the project root.
Worked for 5.5 Days including playtesting and bug fixigng + Building for android.

This is a test assignment completed for PlayStudios. All core functionalities are implemented, and Iâ€™ve done my best to follow S.O.L.I.D, D.R.Y., and other design principles. The project does not include any SFX or VFX, but thanks to its clean architecture, they can be added easily but I didnâ€™t have time for it now.

Iâ€™ve also played a lot of PlayStudios Tetris Block, which I really enjoyed, and I tried to stay as close as possible to it in terms of gameplay and feel and that's why I intentionally didnâ€™t implement a drag offset (which is easy to add if needed).
There's also a highlight feature that shows the first available space for placing a tetromino. I originally added this to speed up playtesting, but it could also work as a hint system later on.ðŸ˜„

Iâ€™ve developed a few small tools to make defining new Tetrominos and Blocks quick and easy. All score-related settings are accessible via the TetrisBlock > Settings menu.

Thereâ€™s still more that could be added and refined, but I believe the current version is enough to showcase my coding style and skills. I didnâ€™t want to spend additional time beyond what was needed for this purpose.
